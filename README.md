Dictation using speech recognition could potentially serve as an efficient input method for mailing devices for blind.
However, dictation systems follows a speech interaction model.
We introduce Voice Typing, a new speech interaction model where blinds, utterances are transcribed as they produce them to enable real-time error identification.
Voice Typing aspires to create an experience to having a secure type for you, while you monitor.

So, it is basically designed to help handicapped people, who face difficulties in accessing the computer system.
Voice mail architecture helps blind people to access e-mail. It basically describes the voice mail architecture that can be used by blind people to access their E-mails.
This architecture will also reduce cognitive load taken by blind to remember and type characters using keyboard.
If this system is implemented as a mobile application, SMSs can be read by the system itself.
